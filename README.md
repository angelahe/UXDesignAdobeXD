## Task Flows

### Task Flows

-SIMPLE, SINGLE PATHWAYS
-NO BRANCHES
-CAN BE PART OF A LARGER USER FLOW
-CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE USER'S PERSPECTIVE
-JUST SHOW THE PAGES/SCREENS/STEPS OF A SPECIFIC TASK 
    (NOT THE USER ACTIONS AND DECISIONS)
-DON'T SHOW EXPLICIT ENTRY (START) AND EXIT (END) POINTS

### Overlap
-PURPOSE IS TO SHOW HOW PEOPLE PROGRESS/SEQUENCE/FLOW THROUGH A DESIGN
-MEANT TO CATCH INTERACTION DESIGN ISSUES, SUCH AS DEAD ENDS OR GAPS IN DESIGN
-USED AS PLANNING TOOLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH APP MAPS AND SITE MAPS
-USED TO DETERMINE THE KEY PAGES/SCREENS THAT NEED TO BE DESIGNED,
    PRIOR TO STARTING WIREFRAMING

### user flows
-COMPLEX PATHWAYS
-SHOW USER DECISION POINTS/NODES
-CAN BRANCH OUT
-SHOW ENTRY/START AND EXIT/END POINTS
-SHOW PROPOSED PAGES/SCREENS, PLUS USER INTERACTIONS, USER DECISIONS, AND SYSTEM DECISIONS
-SPECIFIC TO PARTICULAR USERS/TARGET AUDIENCES/PERSONAS
-CAN BE USED TO SHOW HOW DIFFERENT USERS MIGHT ACCOMPLISH SIMILAR GOALS IN DIFFERENT WAYS
