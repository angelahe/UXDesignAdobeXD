## assignment notes on what learned
I didn't know how to see the layers from the video, so I went to Adobe's site and did the quick getting started tutorial.  since I learned about repeat grid, I used it to create the product details.  Also used reflect to get the down arrow for the quantity (that I added).  still kept it simple, just started to make it my own.  I've shopped on Amazon a million times, so I used part of their familiar flow for buying and some of the same verbiage.  Since the pandemic, a lot of people shop on Amazon now, so I patterned a couple of the design patterns from there.  I decided that since my target user always has the latest tech, she'd have a big shiny phone, so my design fit into the alloted screen space.
